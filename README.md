# grocery-delivery-website
A grocery development website is an online platform designed to enable customers to purchase groceries and household essentials online. It typically features a wide selection of products, including fresh produce, meat, dairy, packaged goods, and personal care items.

The website's interface usually allows customers to browse products by category, search for specific items, and add products to a virtual shopping cart. Customers can then proceed to checkout, where they provide their delivery or pickup information, select a payment method, and finalize their purchase.
